Fork it and use it if you like it.

## Setup
Make sure you have the latest version of node.js installed on your device. If not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
After installing node open the terminal and go to the folder of your theme.
Type the following below to install all the packages ready.
```
npm install
```

If you havent installed the Gulp commandline interface yet, enter the following below to install it globally.
```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

After all the packages have been installed, type in `gulp` to startup the Gulp process.
This will startup a few of the processes like Autoprefixing and Minifying for CSS.
```
gulp
```

To exit gulp press `ctrl` + `z`.
More processes can be added through NPM if needed.
